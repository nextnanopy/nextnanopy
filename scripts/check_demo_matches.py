"""Verify the bundled demo input matches the one shipped in the portable build.

The repo keeps a copy of nextnano's DoubleQuantumWell demo under
``templates/input files/`` and runs it as the CI smoke test. This checks that
copy is still identical to the demo shipped in the extracted portable build, so
the smoke test always exercises the canonical example rather than a drifted
fork. The comparison ignores line-ending and BOM encoding (``read_text`` folds
newlines; ``utf-8-sig`` drops a leading BOM) so it does not fail on CRLF/LF
differences introduced at checkout.

Environment
-----------
NEXTNANO_PORTABLE_DIR
    Directory the portable build was extracted into (default: ``nextnano``).
